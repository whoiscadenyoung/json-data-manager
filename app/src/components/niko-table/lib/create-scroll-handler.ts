/**
 * Builds the body-scroll listener used by every data-table body
 * (regular, virtualized, virtualized-DnD ×2). Reads the scroll
 * container's metrics on each event and dispatches:
 *
 * - `onScroll` with a `ScrollEvent` snapshot
 * - `onScrolledTop` when at the top
 * - `onScrolledBottom` when within `scrollThreshold` of the bottom
 *
 * The body shipped four byte-for-byte copies of this — extracted so
 * scroll-math changes propagate to all four bodies and so consumers
 * get one canonical attach point. The returned listener is intended
 * to be passed to `addEventListener("scroll", handler, { passive: true })`.
 *
 * Why a factory instead of `useCallback` per body: the closure deps
 * are stable across renders (the consumer-supplied callbacks +
 * threshold are passed as args once), and bodies that wrap this in
 * a `useEffect` already key on those callbacks via their own deps.

   * Edge gating: `onScrolledTop` / `onScrolledBottom` previously fired on
   * EVERY scroll event while sitting at the edge — pinning at the bottom
   * while data streamed in re-fired `onScrolledBottom` dozens of times per
   * second. Tracking previous edge state limits firing to the leading edge
   * (false→true) and is the actual source of the perf win.
   *
   * No rAF: iOS Safari pauses `requestAnimationFrame` during momentum
   * scroll, which delayed edge callbacks until the finger lifted and
   * momentum settled — broke infinite-scroll triggering on touch.
   * Dispatch synchronously instead; the scroll math is cheap and edge
   * gating already prevents redundant consumer renders. rAF is better
   * reserved for DOM writes (row virtualization translateY), not
   * consumer callbacks.
